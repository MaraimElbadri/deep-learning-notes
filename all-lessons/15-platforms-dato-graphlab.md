# Dato Graphlab Create

A platform great for graph analytics and other ML algorithms.

It offers 2 deep nets and multiple ML algorithms.

## 2 Deep nets

It offers 2 nets depending on the nature of the input data.

## Convoluted Neural Networks
If you supply graphlab with input data, the default selection will be a Convoluted Neural Network.

## Multilayer Perceptron

With any other kind of data, the default is an MLP.

## Machine Learning

It has multiple ML algorithms including:

* Text analytics 
* Classification
* Regression
* Clustering
* Graph Analytics (unique for ML platforms)

## Training Data Loads

Similarly to H2o, it provides some data-munching features, together with integrations to:

* HDFS
* Amazon S3
* SQL DB
* SPARK RDD
* PANDAS DF

## Interface

* Intuitive UI for model building
* Visualisations - graphlab canvas (sophisticated visuals)

## How to use

It's provided as a downloadable software library, so would have to be deployed in own hardware.

Offers 4 types of built-in storage:

* GPU Support
* SArray - Columnar Representation
* SFrame - Tabular Data Structure
* SGraph - Built in Graph structure 

These tools are used to handle terabytes of data at interactive speeds.

You can use graphlab models to build predictive analytics tools that can be set up as services and can be accessed through APIs.
