# Torch 

High quality Deep Learning library with a lot of support and large community

Offers GPU support 

Offers the option to setup a deep net by configuring its hyperparameters and other useful features.

## History

Developed by Ronin and another guy from Facebook, another guy from twitter and another from Deep mind. Pretty cool!

## LuaJIT Library

Torch is a library for LuaJIT - a popular implementation of Lua.

The library provides a powerful vectorized implementation of the math behidn Deep Learning algorithms.

There are many libraries that extend torch's functionality - supported by a large community.

## Hyper-parameters Configuration

To some extent, torch allows you to setup, train and run a deep net by configuring its hyperparameters.

Once configured, a deep net can be called from the routines of our programmes.

## Extensions

Torch has many extensions that allow you to build almost any of the deep nets that we've covered.

* CuTorch - Provides GPU support
* NN - Allows you to work with different architectures and stack different nets together
* Cephes - Extends torch with a specialized math library
* DP - streamlines R&D process
* NNGraph - Provides graph tools for the NN library
