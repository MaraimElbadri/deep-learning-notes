# Transfer Learning with Indico

Any list of recommended items in a website are often built by analyzing past purchasing behavior of customers.

Deep Networks are revolutionizing this aspect of the fashion world by learning to identify matching combinations that most people would find appealing.

Indico is a cloud-based deep learning service that has used the concept of **transfer learning** to build a Deep Network for the fashion matching problem.

## About indico

A group in boston aiming to drive forward innovation through Deep Networks

Deep Network algorithms have enabled companies to extract meaningful information from unstructured data.

The team has built a custom collection API, which is a large set of features trained on a large number of examples.

Using transfer learning their models can use messy unstructured data, making them even more effective.

## Transfer learning

Machine Learning models are excellent for recognizing patterns within a narrow domain.

Transfer learning allows you to take a model that has been trained to solve one task, and tweak it to solve another task.

This is a familiar concept in the ML space.

However recent progress in Deep Learning has made it much more effective.

This is because Deep Neural Networks learn many layers of features, and when properly trained, the knowledge encoded in these features can be used to solve many related tasks and not just the one it was trained to solve.

So instead of training a model from scratch every time, you can jumpstart your model using similar features from a pre-trained model, and then use your data to fine-tune the features for your specific problem.

With traditional ML, all these learned features were written by hand. The model doesn't figure them out by itself.

**Deep learning models do**

So transfer learning would not work as well with traditional machine learning features.

For interesting problems, no-one knows how to write transferable features by hand.

## Indico and Transfer Learning

Indico's custom collection API is built around this idea of knowledge transfer.

### Example

Since the API has been trained from large volume of text data, you could potentially fine tune the API for a specific natural language processing task for a language of your choosing.

Because of transfer learning, you'd need a much smaller training set than if you were building the net from scratch, and you'd still be able to obtain remarkably good accuracy.

The API has also been trained on many images, so the same holds for image recognition applications.
