# Caffe Library

Library for machine vision or forecasting application

This library lets you build Deep Networks with a sophisticated set of configuration options.

You can access pre-made nets **uploaded to the website.**

## History

Created by YangQuing Jia @ Google Who won an imagenet challenge

## Language

Caffe was originally designed for machine vision tasks, so it's good for convolutional nets.

However, recent versions of the library, provide support for speech and text, reinforcement learning, and recurrent nets for sequence processing

Caffe is a C++ library with CUDA.

Applications can easily switch from GPU and CPU.

**MATLAB and Python interfaces are also available.**

## Features

With Caffe you can build a deep net by configuring its hyper-parameters.

The layer configuration options are very sophisticated.

You can create a net with many different types of layers, such as a vision layer, a loss layer, an activation layer and a few others - so each layer can have a different function or take on a different role.

This flexibility allows you to develop extremely complex deep nets for your application. 

Caffee is supported by a large community where users can contribute with their own Deep Network to a repository called the **Model Zoo**.

AlexNet and GoogleNet are two popular user-made nets available to the community.

**There are also a few educational resources**

Caffe is a great place to start.

## Performance

Cafe vectorizes data through **BLOBS**.

BLOBS are a type of array that speeds up data analysis and provides synchronization capabilities between CPU and GPU.
