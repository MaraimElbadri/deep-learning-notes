main functions get an input, process complex sets of calculations and provide an output.\nThis chapter focuses on classification.\nRecommended resources:\n\nMark Neilson's book\nAndrew Ng ML Class\n\nClassification\nCategorising a group of objects by only using some basic data features that describe them. Examples:\n\nLogistic regression\nSVMs\nNaive Bayes\n\nThe firing of a classifier, or activation, produces a score.\nExample\nIf you have to say whether a patient is healthy, and all you have is height, weight and body temperature.\nThe classifier would get the data, process it and provide a score:\n\nA low score would suggest they are sick\nA high score would suggest they are healthy\n\nNeural Network Layers\nNNs can be used in classification problems when an object can fall in 1 of 2 or more options.\nUnlike other networks (like graphs, etc), a NN comes in layers.\n\nInput layer - the first layer\nOutput layer - the last layer\nHidden layers - the layers in the middle\n\nA neural net can be viewed as a result of putting together a set of individual classifiers together in a layered web. Each node in the layers has an own classifier.\nInputs from one node are taken from multiple nodes in the previous layer, and the result is passed to the next layer, and this repeats until it reaches the output layer.\nThe results of the classification are determined by the score at each node.\nForward Propagation - The NN's way to classify a set of inputs through the nodes in the layers.\nMulti-layered perceptron\nNNs came out from the need to improve performance of perceptron classifiers.\nBy using a layered web of perceptrons, the accuracy of predictions could be improved. \nThis new breed of NNs are called Multi-layered perceptron or MLPs.\nSince then, the nodes inside NNs have replaced perceptrons with more accurate classifiers (But the name MLP has stuck). \nWeights and Biases\nIf you have a NN with nodes that have the same classifier and the nodes don't fire randomly, then the same input will get the same output every time. \nThen why would nodes in the network have different outputs? Because each set of inputs is modified by different sets of weights and biases.\n\nWeight* - The weight in the edges that connect the nodes\nBias* - Extra weight that is added in each node\n\nTraining\nThe prediction accuracy depends on its weights and biases.\nWe want the accuracy to be hight.\nWe want the NN to predict an output that is as close as possible to the actual output.\nThe process to improve a NN's accuracy is called training.\nCost - The difference between the output obtained and the actual output.\nThe point of training is to minimize the cost.\nResources\n\nMichael Nielsen's book - http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/\nAndrew Ng's class - https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\n\n"},"sections/3-three-reasons-to-use-deep-learning.html":{"url":"sections/3-three-reasons-to-use-deep-learning.html","title":"3-three-reasons-to-use-deep-learning - ","keywords":"","body":"Pattern Recognition\nNeural networks are ideal to identify patterns.\nGPUs can train neural networks faster than ever before.\nPattern Complexity\nSimple patterns could be solved with SVMs or logistic regression.\nBut when there is moderate complexity, deep networks would outperform.\nAs patterns get more complex, neural networks with more layers can become unusable.\nNumber of nodes required in each layer grows exponentially with the number of possible patterns in the data\nIn this case training becomes too expensive, and accuracy falls.\nShallow networks are not a good option for this, the actual good choice is...\nDeep Networks\nRecognizing complex patterns\nDeep networks break down complex patterns into a set of less complex patterns.\nExample\nA deep net wants to understand whether a picture contains a human face.

The training process like a rock rolling down. When the gradient is large, the net will train quickly, and vice versa.\nIn a complex network with multiple layers, the gradient can vanish / decay as it goes through the net. \nThe gradients are much smaller in the earlier layers.\nAs a result the earlier layers are the slowest to train. This is a fundamental problem.\nThe earlier layers are the ones that recognize the simple patterns and building blocks (as in the example in the prev chapter). If the earlier layers get it wrong, the rest will be bounded to be incorrect.\nBackpropagation\nThe process used to train a neural network.\nWhilst forwardprop starts with the inputs and works its way forward, backprop goes the other way. \nIt calculates the gradient from right to left. Each time to calculate the gradient, it uses the previous gradients up to that point.\nExample\nIf we take a node in the penultimate layer, we can see its connected to multiple nodes in the output layer, and use them to calculate the gradient.\nAs you keep going back in the layers, we have to use a lot of gradients.\nBackprop gradient calculation\nA gradient at any point is the product of the previous gradients up to that point. The product of two numbers between 0 and 1 gives you a smaller number...\nImplications\n\nTakes a lot of time\nAccuracy is very low\n\nUntil 2006...\nDeep nets were underperforming shallow nets, but everything changed after 3 breakthrough papers, published by Hinton, Laocoon and Bengio.\n"},"sections/6-restricted-boltzmann-machines.html":{"url":"sections/6-restricted-boltzmann-machines.html","title":"6-restricted-boltzmann-machines - ","keywords":"","body":"Restricted Boltzmann Machines\nA method that can automatically find patterns in our data by automatically reconstructing the input.\nGeoff Hinton\nUni of Toronto, first researcher to release way to train deep nets, creating RBMs.\nBecause of his work, he's referred as one of the fathers of Deep Learning.\nRBM Structure\nA shallow 2-layer net with:\n\nLayer 1: Visible layer\nLayer 2: Hidden layer\n\nEach node in the visible layer is connected to each node in the hidden layer.\nRBMs are restricted - An RBM is considered restricted because no 2 nodes in the same layer share a connection.\nAn RBM is a mathematical equivalent of a two way translator.\nRBM Process\n\nForward pass - RBMs takes the inputs and translates into a set of numbers that encode the inputs.\nBackwards pass - RBM takes the set of numbers and takes it back to form the reconstructed inputs.\n\nA well trained net would be able to perform the backwards translation with a high degree of accuracy.\nIn both steps, the weights and biases have very important roles.

In the CNN, neurons perform a convolution operation.\nBy just drawing a box around a set of flashlights, we can see that unlike with normal networks, every neuron is not connected to neurons in adjacent layers; instead, a CNN has a flashlight structure.\nFlashlight structure - Each neuron is only connected to the input neuron it shines upon.\nThe neurons in the same filter share the same weight and bias parameters. This means that anywhere in the filter, a given neuron is connected to the same number of input neurons, and has the same weights and biases.\n\nThis is what allows the filter to look for the same pattern in different sections of the image\n\nBy arranging these neurons in the same structure as the flashlight grid, we ensure that the entire image is scanned.\nRelu and Pooling\nThe next two layers that follow.\nBoth of which that help to build up the simple patterns discovered by the convolutional layer.\nEach node in the convolutional layer is connected to a node that fires in other nets.\nRectified Linear Unit (RELU) layer\nThe activation used is called Rectified Linear Unit (RELU)\nCNNs are trained using backpropagation, so the vanishing gradient is once again a POTENTIAL ISSUE!\nFor reasons that depend on the mathematical definition of RELU, the gradient is held more or less constant at every layer of the net.\nSo the RELU activation allows the net to be properly trained without harmful slowdowns in the crucial early layers.\nPooling layer\nThe pooling layer is used for dimensionality reduction.\nCNNs tile multiple instances of convolutional layers and RELU layers together in a sequence in order to build more and more complex patterns.\nThe problem with this is that the number of possible patterns becomes exceedingly large.\nBy introducing pooling layers, we ensure that the net focus is only on the most relevant patterns discovered by convolution and RELU.\nThis limits both the memory and processing requirements to running a CNN.\nFully Connected (FC) layer\nTogether, these 3 layers can discover a hose of complex patterns, but the net won't have an understanding of what these patterns mean.\nThis is why a Fully Connected (FC) layer is attached to the end of the net in order to equip the net to classify data samples.\nHistory\nPioneered by Yann Legun from NYU uni - director of FB AI group.

Teams use GPUs for training tasks on sentiment analysis and helpfulness extraction.\nGPUs were able to train the nets 250 times faster ( 1 day vs 8 months training )\nWhen to use RNNs vs FFNs\nWe know that FFNs outputs ONE value, which in many cases is a class or a prediction.\nA RNN is suited for time series data, where an output can be the next value in the sequence (or next set of values).\nThe answer depends on whether application calls for classification, regression, or forecasting.\nHistory\nA lot of credit goes to Jurgen Schmidhuber and Sepp Hochreiter\n"},"sections/10-autoencoders.html":{"url":"sections/10-autoencoders.html","title":"10-autoencoders -

","keywords":"","body":"Recursive Neural Tensor Nets\nUsed to discover the hierarchical structure of a set of data.\nExamples are parse trees of groups of sentences.\nRNTNs are a better fit than FFNs or RNNs.\nHistory\nConceived by Richard Socher at Metamind as PHD thesis at Standford.\nPurpose was to analyze data that had a hierarchical structure.\nOriginally designed for sentiment analysis, where the sentiment doesn't just depend on its component words, but **in the order in which they are syntactically grouped\".\nStructure\nRNTN has 3 basic components:\n\nRoot - A parent group\nLeafs - Child Groups\n\nEach group is simply a collection of neurons where the number of neurons depends on the complexity of the input data.\nThe root is connected to both leafs, but leafs are not connected to each other.\nThe 3 components for a binary tree.\nIn general, the leafs receive input, and the root group uses a classifier to fire out a class and a score.\nThe structure might seem simple, but like in a RNN, the complexity comes from the way data moves though the net.\nIn the case of an RNTN, this process is recursive.\nRecursion\nTo see how the recursion works in RNTNs, here's an example:\n\nWe feed an English sentence to an RNTN\nWe receive the sentence's parse tree as an output\n\nSteps:\n\nWe feed the first 2 words into leaf groups 1 and 2 respectively.\nThe 2 vectors move across the net to the root, which processes them and fires 2 values: the class and the score.\nThis is the point where the net starts the recursion\nThe current parse is passed to the left leaf above, whilst the right leaf receives the following word in the sentence\nAt this point, the root group would output the score of a parse which is 3 words long \nThis continues until all the inputs (words) are used up. The net has a parse tree with every single word included\n\nOverview of example\nThis simplifies the main idea behind an RNTN, but in a practical application, we typically encounter more complex recursive processes. \nRather than using the next word in the sentence for the second leaf group, an RNTN would try all of the next words, and eventually vectors that represent entire sub-parses.\nBy doing this at every step of the recursive process, the net is able to analyze and score any possible syntactical parse.\nTerms\nThe class: Represents an encoding of the structure in the current parse\nThe score: Represents the quality of the current parse\nPractical note: The leaf groups don't actually receive the words per say, but rather vector representations of the words. Particularly, good results are achieve when the numbers in the two vectors encode the similarities between the two words when compared to other words in the vocabulary.\nChoice of structure\nIt's possible to build a structure that holds the weight to the right, in the centre or to the left.\nIn order to chose the best structure, the net relies on the score value produced by the root group.\nBy using this score to select the best structure at each step of the recursive process, the net will produce the highest scoring parse as its final output.\nLabeling\nOnce the net has the final structure, it backtracks through the parse tree, in order to figure out the right grammatical label for each part of the sentence.\nIn an example \"The car is fast\", you could have the first two words labeled by a leaf+root group as a \"noun phrase\", and the last two ones as a \"verb phrase\". Then it would work its way up, and when it reaches the top, it adds a special label that signifies the beginning of the parse structure.\nBackpropagation\nRNTNs are trained with backpropagation by comparing the predictive sentence structure with the proper sentence structure obtained from a set of labeled training data.\nOnce trained, it will now give higher score to structures that are more similar to the parse trees it saw during training.\nParsing\nText processing\nRNTNs are used in NLP for both syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.\nImage parsing\nAlso used to parse images, typically when an image contains a scene with many different components.\n"},"sections/12-deep-learning-use-cases.html":{"url":"sections/12-deep-learning-use-cases.html","title":"12-deep-learning-use-cases - ","keywords":"","body":"Deep Learning\nDeep learning is just getting started, and new applications are just going to start appearing.\nMachine Vision\nMachine Vision is one of the biggest applications of deep learning.\nImage Classification\nImage search systems use Deep Learning for image classification and automatic tagging.\nThis allows the images to be accessible through standard search queries.\nCompanies like Facebook use Deep Networks to scan pictures for faces at many different angles, and then label the face with proper name.\nObject Recognition\nDeep Networks are used to recognize objects within images.\nThis allows images to be searchable based on the objects within them.\nExample: Clarifai\nUses Convoluted Neural Networks to recognize things and concepts in digital images.\nTheir demo allows you to upload/select an image; if we upload a picture of a dinner table, it would give the tags \"no person\", \"table\", \"elegant\", \"indoors\", \"luxury\", \"furniture\", \"fashion\", \"decoration\", \"tableware\", \"party\".\nIt also finds images very similar to the ones you upload.\nIt also shows other images with other examples, showing food, animals, etc and their tags.\nImage and Video Parsing\nVideo recognition systems are important tools for driverless cars, remote robots and theft detection.\nSpeech recognition\nThis field also got a powerful boost with the intro of deep networks.\nFact Extraction\nDeep Networks can be used to extract relations from facts in text.\n\nPresident Barack completed his tour of Asia, met with leaders, and returned to the US\n\nFacts: 1) Obama is the president of the US. 2) Obama met with leaders. 3) Asia has leaders\n\n\nMachine Translation\nAutomatically translate text to other languages\nSentiment analysis\nThese networks are really good at sentiment analysis applications, and can be used in movie ratings and new product intros.\nDemo of Metamind\nMetamind uses an Recursive Neural Tensor Network (RNTN) to provide sentiment analysis.\nApp by Richard Sawker to find sentiment in tweets.

from smartphones, to simple servers, to giant servers with GPUs.\nThis library would improve the portability of ML so that research models can be more easily applied to commercial applications.\nEventhough tensorflow is 6 months all it's the most popular lib in github.\nComputational Graph\nMuch like the Theano library, tensorflow is based on the concept of a computational graph.\nIn a computational graph, nodes represent their persistent data or a math operation.\nEdges represent the flow of data between nodes.\nThe data that flows through these edges is a multidimentional array known as a TENSOR\nThe output of an operation or set of operations is then fed as an input of the next. \nEventhough Tensorflow was designed to support neural networks, it can support any domain where computation can be modeled as a data flow graph.\nResources\nTensorflow also adopts some useful features from Theano such as:\n\nDifferentiation\nCommon Sub-expression elimination\nShared and Symbolic Variables \n\nFor an open source library it has comprehensive documentation, as well as a massive online course in udacity.\nNetwork Support\nDifferent type of Neural Networks can be supported by tensorflow.\nHowever there is currently no support for hyperparameter configuration.\nFor now users can use KERAS to support hyperparameters in tensorflow.\nInterface\nCurrently Tensorflow has a C++ interface\nThe team hopes that community will build more programming language support with SWIG.\nThere was a release of Ruby.\nPerformance\nTensorflow and theano seem simlar in many ways, but there are several key differences. \nWhen tensorflow was released in November of 2015, its compile and runtimes were much slower than theano, but the tensorflow community have fought to combat these issues.\nAn update in April 2015 tensorflow performed well in image category.\nParallelism\nAnother improvement over theano comes in parallelism support.\nDeeplearning4J supports the training of a ML model on a distributed framework through Iterative Map Reduce.\nData Parallelism\nData parallelism is implemented in a later release known as distributed tensorflow 0.8.\nData parallelism allows you to train different subsets of the data in different nodes in a cluster for each training pass.\nFollowed by parameter averaging and replacement across the cluster.\nModel Parallelism\nV0.8 also implements model parallelism.\nDifferent portions of the model are trained in different devices in parallel.\nFor example you can use model parallelism to train stacked RNNs by deploying each RNN in a different device.\nOpenCL\nAlthough many ML libraries support CUDA, few support OpenCL (A fast rising standard for GPU computing)\nTensorflow has added OpenCL support to the roadmap.\nTensorboard\nA visualisation tool for network architecture and performance.\nThe tool allows you to zoom in and visualize different levels of the network.\nYou can also view different summary level metrics, and changes overtime of the training process.\nResources\n\nSoumith Chintala benchmarks -

\"What percentave of these positives was the model able to correctly identify\". True Positives / Total number of positives\nPrecision - \"What percentage of these predictions were actually positive?\". True Positives / Number of classified as positive\n\nThese questions give you the number of positive datapoints it was able to recall, and how precise were the actual predictions. \nRecall and precision are defined for the negative as well.\nGoing back for example\nIf we take our model that just gave a negative diagnose, our model had a recall of 0, because it failed to identify any patients with a positive diagnosis.\nExample 3\nConsider a model that examines a pool of applicants from a top 5 business school, and determines who to accept.\nWe will say that accepting a student is a positive, and rejecting is negative.\nOnly the very best will be accepted.\nGiven the extremely number of false positives, the model would have a high precision value.\nBut there would be a large number of qualified students that will fail, and this will be the false negatives - hence the model would have a low recall value\nExample 4\nLet's take a model for a state college, which would be designed a bit differently.\nThe goal is to accept a much larger set of students.\nA few underqualified students will be accepted, so the false positive count will be high, so it would have a low precision.\nBut unlike the other model, very few qualified students will be overlooked. \nSo the number of false negatives would be low, so it would have a high recall.\nF1 score\nWe can use hybrid measurements in order to achieve a balance between precision and recall.\nOnce of these models is the F1 score - it is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\nThis outperforms the standard arithmetic mean in the presence of outliers.\nThe harmonic mean also offers an improvement when the features have values between 0 and 1. \nThis becomes handy in the process of feature scaling.\nWe can also examine precision and recall graphically by plotting these values and examining the area under the curve.\nThe model that maximises this area will typically be the best performing\nMulti-class classification\nWe can extend this concepts to classification problems with more than two classes.\nThis would just need a matrix that is bigger than the usual 2x2 confusion matrix.\nThe definition for precision and recall remain the same - the only difference is that now a data class can be misclassified in multiple ways.\nSo false positives and false negatives must be summed through all missclassification pairs. \nSo for multiclass classification:\n\nPrecision - The number of true positives over all points classified positive\nRecall - The ratio of number of true positives over number of all positives\n\n"},"sections/24-deep-network-performance.html":{"url":"sections/24-deep-network-performance.html","title":"24-deep-network-performance - ","keywords":"","body":"Performance\nGPUs are important.\nGPUs are a powerful tool for training Deep Networks.\nWhen it comes to speeding up training process, there are alternatives to GPUs.\nCPU Characteristics\nCPUs comes with a cost - they require sophisticated control mechanisms in order to manage the flow of tasks.\nCPU is also designed to perform tasks serially one after another rather than in parallel.\nParallelism can be achieved by building an unlimited number of cores directly in the CPU.\nThe cores are versatile but they need to be created with general purpose computing in mind.\nClock speeds haven't improved as much in the last few years, eventhough there has been minor improvements with CPU memory.\nA CPU is impractical for large scale deep nets.\nOpportunity\nVectors\nWe can implement deep nets using vectors and vector algebra.\nAddition, dot product and transposes are operations that can be performed in parallel.\nEach multiplication of the dot product can be performed in parallel, and the resulting products can be added together.\nBy using a parallel implementation, deeps nets can be trained much faster.\nParallelism implemented at a hardware level is known as parallel processing.\nParallelism at the software level is parallel programming.\nParallel Processing\nImplemented at hardware level\nCan be broken down into:\n\nShared memory\nDistributed computing\n\nShared memory options: GPU\nUnlike CPUs, it has hundreds/thousands of cores.\nEach GPU core is capable of general purpose computing\nAny parallel task can be performed in GPUs\nThe most popular application of GPUs is the training process.\nDeep learning community provides support to GPU with libraries, implementations, and an ecosystem fostered by nvidia.\nDisadvantage: High power consumption.

a model that estimates the likelihood of seeing a particular component in a body of natural language.\nOne example is the trigram model which attempts to calculate the probability of seeing a specific sequence of 3 worlds in a natural language corpus.\nDisadvantages\nLanguage is subjective and ambiguous: Sometimes a word can have different meanings depending on the context. \nIt can also be difficult to add new words to an existing model, so NLP often requires a lot of manual curation.\nThis added labour comes at the cost of variable quality and consistency.\nDeep learning in NLP\nDeep Learning is an important tool that overcomes the limitations of NLP.\nThe main difference between DL and other methods is the use of vectors.\nTo represent a word, a DL model might use a one hot vector implementation\nOne-Hot Vector\nThe implementation that DL uses to represent words as vectors.\nIt has its roots in digital circuit design.\nIn this form each word is represented as a vector who's length is the size of the entire vocabulary.\nEvery value in the vector is set to zero except to the value of the word which is set to 1.\nThis can get out of hand if vocab size is large.\nLarge vectors can slow down processing time.\nGoogle IT\nThe google IT corpus has a vocab of 13m words.\nTo store these words as one-hot vectors, we would need 13m vectors, each of size 13m.\nDimensionality Reduction\nDR is one application for which one-hot vectors are used.\nContinuous Bag of Words\nIf you have a word w, surrounded by a fix set of words called Context.\nIn this model, the context is used as a set of features to predict what W might be, in a type of fill-in-the-blanks application.\nA shallow Neural Network is used for this task with the input layer containing one hot vectors for the context words.\nThe output fires the predicted target wall.\nSkip grams\nThis is the reverse of the continuous bag of words model.\nIt provides the context words given a target word.\nSince only the target word is used as input instead of the context words, the inputs of the hidden layer would be much smaller.\nAs a result, we can use the hidden layer's activation to represent the target word, rather than use the long one-hot vector form.\nBasically we can reduce the input vector's dimensionality.\nTools\nThere are several tools for converting words into vectors, including:\n\nWord2vec from google\nGloVe\n\nMethods 2.0\nOnce the words can be represented by vectors, they can be used with Deep Networks.\nSyntactic Parsing\nAn old problem that received a big boost from the use of Recursive Neural Tensor Networks.\n\nFor a brief overview, the RNTN consists of a root node connected to two leaf nodes. \nTwo words are passed to the leaf nodes, with each leaf receiving its own word. \nThe leafs passes the words to the root which processes them, and produces an intermediate parse, along with the score. \nThis parse is fed into the level above, together with the following word. \nThis process is recursive, and continues until all words have been fed into the model. \n\nIn reality the actual process is much more complex as it needs to analyse all possible subparses during the recursive step rather than just using the next word, but by doing so it's able to analyse and score every possible syntactic parse.\nMachine Translation\nA recurrent net can take a sequence of inputs along with the time delay, and produce a sequence of outputs.\nA properly trained recurrent net can learn the inherent syntactic and semantic relationships of multiple different languages.\nWhen the net is fed a sequence of words in one language, it knows how to generate the appropriate sequence of words in another language.\nSentiment Extraction\nRNTNs can also be used for sentiment analysis.\nSentiment, like syntax, is hierarchical in nature, and a single word in the right place can change an entire meaning in a sentence.\nAn example from his thesis shows an RNTN tree with a sentence.\nWhilst a normal process would label the sentence as negative as there are more negative terms than positive ones, an RNTN is capable of interpreting the deep semantic structure of the sentence in order to make the right prediction.\n"},"sections/26-configuring-a-deep-net.html":{"url":"sections/26-configuring-a-deep-net.html","title":"26-configuring-a-deep-net -

Two which are:\n\nGrowing \nPruning\n\nGrowing\nYou start with a smaller than expected neuron count, and then you keep adding neurons throughout the training process until the cost is no longer affected.\nPruning\nThe reverse to growing.\nYou start with an excess of neurons and keep removing until there is a cost difference.\nDisadvantages of Growing & Pruning\nThey are computationally expensive.\nIf resources are limited, a better approach is to start with excess of neurons, and then use a regulariser to prevent overfitting.\nActivation Functions\n\nThe most popular is the Logistic Unit / Sigmoid.\nHyperbolic tangent (Tanh)\nRectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\n\nReLU is an approach to fight the vanishing gradient when working with Backpropagation.\nThese activations all come with their own variants.\nFeel free to experiment and pick the one that suits your needs.\nRegularization\nAn overconfigured net may lead to overfitting.\nHowever when we combine an overconfigured network with a regularizor, we typically end up with a model that can regularize well to new datapoints.\nRegularizors include:\n\n3 way split\nl1 / l2 limit\nDropout (turning off neurons)\n\nThe reason is that a net with more neurons has more ways to combine its weights and biases. \nAs a result there are more possible patterns that a network can learn to recognize.\nSo there is a better chance of finding some kind of weight and baias configuration with the lowest possible cost.\nGating\nThis is another thing to bare in mind in regards to architecture.\nIf you need to build in recurrence, you will need to carefully consider the size of the net's input memory.\nThis will determine how much of the past input the net is required to remember.\nGating units such as GRUs and LSTMs are designed specifically to remember specific parts of an input sequence.\nLearning Rate\nThe success of the training process depends heavily on the choice of parameters.\nBackpropagation is sensitive to the learning rate\nIf the rate is too large the algorithm might simply skip over the point it minimizes all cost.\nIf the rate is too small, the training process would take an unreasonable amount of time.\nA common practice is to use a rate that changes as training processes.\nGenerally, the rate starts out large to speed up training, and decreases gradually as training progresses.\nIn this case, the net starts by learning about the patterns in a broad sense, and then ti starts fine-tuning its understanding.\nSome strategies to dynamically alter the learning rate include:\n\nAdaGrad\nRMSProp\nAdaDelta\n\nInitialization\nBefore a net can be trained, it is necessary to assign starting values to the weights and biases in a process called Initialization.\nThe easiest solution is to simply randomize the values.\nBut since quality of initial weights has such a big effect on training times this is not appropriate.\nMost advanced methods are beyond the scope of the video, but for example, a Deep Belief Network may use an RBM to set the initial weights and biases.\nTraining Time\nWhen working with RNNs, it's possible to use techniques like gradient clipping and steeper gates to speed up the training\nBut generally speaking, if you've exhausted all the available options, and your Deep Networks are still short of performance targets, just raise the number of training epochs.\nThis strategy will work for any deep net.\n"},"sections/27-transfer-learning.html":{"url":"sections/27-transfer-learning.html","title":"27-transfer-learning -

but instead a target number for the maximum reward.\nSo it was actually dealing with regression, not classification.\nThey also didn't use pooling layers, since unlike image recognition, individual positions of game objects like the player are important and can't be reduced.\nA recurrent network could be used too, as long as the output layer was tailored for regression, and the input at each timestep included the action and the environment state.\nDeep Q Network\nThere is also the Deep Q Network, or DQN.\nIt also uses the principles of predicting the maximum reward given a state and an action. \nIt was patented by google, and it has seen a lot of improvements like the experience replay, and the dooling network architecture.\nSupervised learning\nReinforcement learning isn't just a fancy way to say \"Supervised learning\".\nSupervised learning is all about making sense of the environment based on historical examples.\nHowever, that is not always the best way of doing things.\nImagine if you're trying to drive a car in heavy traffic based on the road patterns you observed the week before where the roads where clear. Or like driving only looking at the rear-look mirror.\nReinforcement learning is all about reward. You get points for your actions, like staying in your lane, signalling when you need to.\nYou can also lose points for dangerous actions like tailgating and speeding.\nThe objective is to get the maximum number of points possible given the current state of the traffic on the road around you.\nReinforcement learning emphasises that an action results in a change in the state which supervised learning doesn't focus on.\nExploration vs Exploitation\nIn April 2016 Jeff BEzoz said how amazon is great to fail and most companies cannot go through failed experiments.\nMost organizations are used to operate in the realms of conventional wisdom, which is about exploiting what is known to achieve finite rewards with known odds.\nSome groups venture into the unknown and explore new territory, looking for rewards. Many organizations fail, but some succeed and change the world.\nWith reinforcement learning, an agent can explore the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, and choose the path to the maximum expected reward.\nGlobal Approach\nDeep Reinforcement learning falls in the broader umbrella of AI, and between Deep Learning and Reinforcement learning.\nIt involves topics like goal setting, planning and perception.\nAnd it can build a link between AI and engineering disciplines.\nRelevant URLs\n\nRichard Sutton book: https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutto...\nTambet Matiisen post: https://www.nervanasys.com/demystifyi...\nAndrej Karpathy post: http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/\n\n"}}}
