# Deep Learning

Deep learning is just getting started, and new applications are just going to start appearing.


## Machine Vision

**Machine Vision** is one of the biggest applications of deep learning.

### Image Classification

Image search systems use Deep Learning for image classification and automatic tagging.

This allows the images to be accessible through standard search queries.

Companies like Facebook use Deep Networks to scan pictures for faces at many different angles, and then label the face with proper name.

### Object Recognition

Deep Networks are used to recognize objects within images.

This allows images to be searchable based on the objects within them.

 #### Example: Clarifai

Uses Convoluted Neural Networks to recognize things and concepts in digital images.

Their demo allows you to upload/select an image; if we upload a picture of a dinner table, it would give the tags "no person", "table", "elegant", "indoors", "luxury", "furniture", "fashion", "decoration", "tableware", "party".

It also finds images very similar to the ones you upload.

It also shows other images with other examples, showing food, animals, etc and their tags.

## Image and Video Parsing

Video recognition systems are important tools for driverless cars, remote robots and theft detection.

## Speech recognition 

This field also got a powerful boost with the intro of deep networks.

## Fact Extraction

Deep Networks can be used to extract relations from facts in text.
>President Barack completed his tour of Asia, met with leaders, and returned to the US
>>Facts: 1) Obama is the president of the US. 2) Obama met with leaders. 3) Asia has leaders

## Machine Translation

Automatically translate text to other languages

## Sentiment analysis

These networks are really good at sentiment analysis applications, and can be used in **movie ratings** and new **product intros**.

### Demo of Metamind

Metamind uses an Recursive Neural Tensor Network (RNTN) to provide sentiment analysis.

App by Richard Sawker to find sentiment in tweets. You can search by user, hashtag, etc.

## Documents

Deep Networks have found usecases in character level text processing and data classification.

## Medical Field

### Cancer Detection

Standford team used Deep Learning to identify 6k+ factors that help predict chances of cancer patient surviving.

Researchers from IDSIA created a Deep Network model to identify invasive breast cancer cells.

### Drug discovery

In 2012, Merk hosted the molecular activity challenge in order to predict the biological activities of different drug molecules based solely on chemical structure.

As a brief mention, this challenge was won by George Dull from University of Toronto, who led a team by the name of GGG.

### Radiology

Convoluted Neural Networks can detect anomalies like tumors or cancer through the use of data from MRI, FMRI, EKG and CT scans.

## Finance

Deep nets can help make, buy, and sell predictions based on market data streams, portfolio allocations, and risk profiles.

Depending on how they are trained, they are useful for both short term trading and long term investing. 

## Digital Advertising

Deep nets are used to segment users by purchase history in order to offer relevant and personalized Ads in real time.

Based on historical ad-price data, and other factors, Deep Networks can learn to optimally bid for ad space on a given web page.

## Fraud detection

Deep Networks use multiple data sources to flag a transaction that is fraudulent in real time. 

They can also detect which products and markets are most susceptible to fraud.

## Customer Intel

Deep nets are used to gather and sell customer data in order to determine the best up-selling strategies.

## Agriculture

Deep Networks use satellite feeds and sensor data to identify problematic environmental conditions.
